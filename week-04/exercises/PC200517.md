# The Greatests

Write a program that reads integers line by line from the standard input! In each line, the first number determines how many additional numbers are present in that particular line. For each line, the program should print to the standard output how many times the highest value occurs among the numbers from the second number to the end of the line! The input is terminated by a line containing only a single `0`, which the program does not need to process.

## Standard input

```
10 5 2 3 5 4 1 3 5 1 3
1 1
5 5 5 5 5 5
3 1 2 3
0
```

### Standard output

```
3
1
5
1
```
