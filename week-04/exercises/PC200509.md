# Signs

Write a program that reads integers line by line from the standard input! In each line, the first number indicates how many more numbers are there in that line. For each line, the program should count the positive and negative numbers starting from the second number, then write to the standard output the line numbers where there are more positive numbers than negative ones! The input is closed by a line containing only a single `0`, which the program does not need to process anymore.
