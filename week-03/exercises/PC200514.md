# Dog contest

Someone has counted the people and dogs in a dog contest. Later he unfortunately forgot the exact number of dogs. Write a program that reads two numbers in a line of the standard input until `EOF`! The first number represents the number of heads, while the second represents the number of legs. You should determine the number of dogs and people, then write these numbers to the next line of the standard input. Separate the two numbers with a single space. It is guaranteed that all the dogs had four legs, while all the humans had two legs (and exactly one head).

## Standard input

```
15 40
15 50
10 30
2 6
```

### Standard output

```
10 5
5 10
5 5
1 1
```
