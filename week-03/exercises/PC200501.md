# Fractions

Write a program that reads four integer numbers in a line from the standard input! You should consider the first two numbers as the nominator and denominator of the first fraction (in this order), while the third and fourth numbers should be interpreted as the second fraction in the same format. For each test case write one of the relational operators `<`, `>`, and `=` depending on how can you compare the fractions to each other! The last line of the input contains four zeros, this row should not be processed.
