# `PC200656` Pizzas

Write a program that reads pizza data line by line from the standard input until the end of the file. Each line has the following structure:

```
pizza_name;ingredient[;ingredient]…;32cm_price;45cm_price
```

* `pizza_name`: A string of up to `32` characters containing only English letters, digits, hyphens (minus signs), and spaces.

* `ingredient`: A string of up to `32` characters containing only English letters and spaces. There can be multiple ingredients separated by semicolons.

* `32cm_price`: A positive integer representing the price of a 32 cm diameter pizza.

* `45cm_price`: A positive integer representing the price of a 45 cm diameter pizza.

Each data field in a line is separated by a semicolon (`;`).

The program should determine and print the name of the pizza that has the highest number of ingredients.

If multiple pizzas have the same highest number of ingredients, the program should select the first one that appears in the input.

margarita;tomato;mozzarella;840;1640
salami;salami;mozzarella;940;1900
